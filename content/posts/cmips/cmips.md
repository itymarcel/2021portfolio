People in public space, opposed to how initially intended, often use public space as their private space. Initially, public space were places intended to bring people together, so they can create communities and help each other out. Through globalisation and digitisation, this is neglected more and more. <br><br>The “Theo” series is aimed at tackling this by using music as a medium to connect.
